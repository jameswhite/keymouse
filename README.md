I have an older keymouse track so I need to use the [old version](https://www.keymouse.com/download-older-versions)

and it must be run with: `sudo /Applications/KeyMouse.app/Contents/MacOS/keymouse-darwin` in Terminal.app and Terminal.app will need to have Accessibility turned on in Privacy and Security Settings. 


```
"125": {
   "action": 22,
   "row": 5,
   "dev": 1,
   "col": 9,
   "intsetting4": 1, # command
   "intsetting3": 0,
   "intsetting2": 0,
   "intsetting1": 0, # ctrl
   "keyType": 1,
   "keyCode": 43,
   "strsetting4": "",
   "strsetting3": "",
   "strsetting2": "",
   "strsetting1": "",
   "desc": "Tab"
  },
```
