I have an older keymouse track so I need to use the [old version](https://www.keymouse.com/download-older-versions)

and it must be run with: `sudo /Applications/KeyMouse.app/Contents/MacOS/keymouse-darwin` in Terminal.app and Terminal.app will need to have Accessibility turned on in Privacy and Security Settings.
